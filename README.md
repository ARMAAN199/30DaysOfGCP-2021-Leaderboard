## Tech

LeaderBoard uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Google cloud] - Api host
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
- [SASS] - well your know this
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course leaderboard itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/DSC-ChitkaraUniv/30DaysOfGCP-2021-Leaderboard) on GitHub.This being the fork for working offline on the same.
